This is a personal project of my to improve my geo-scripting skills in R, where I play with the rayshader library to create a crispy high-resolution 3D map of my home country Slovenia and its rivers. This was achieved by following the tutorial by Miloš Agathon. Thank you for your knowledge Miloš.

Below you can find the final result.
